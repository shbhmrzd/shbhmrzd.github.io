I'm a software developer with experience working on big data systems.
In this blog, I'll be sharing things I learn along the way.

Check out my previous work on Medium:

[Setting up Isolated Virtual Environments in SparkR](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/setting-up-isolated-virtual-environments-in-sparkr-ff4795db8cfc)

[STL and Holt from R to SparkR](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/stl-and-holt-from-r-to-sparkr-1815bacfe1cc)

Stay tuned for more updates!
